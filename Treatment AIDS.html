<li>Antiretroviral therapy(ART)is the use of HIV infection.People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines(called an HIV regimen)every day.</li>
<li>ART is recommended for everyone infected with HIV should start ART as soon as possible.ART can't cure HIV,but HIV medicines help people infecte with HIV live longer,healthier lives.ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission.</li>
<li>Potential risks of ART include unwanted side effects from HIV medicines and drug interactions between HIV medicines and other medicines a person is taking.Poor adherence-not taking HIV medicines everyday and exactly as prescribed-can lead to drug resistance and treatment failure</li>
