<p>In most cases ,hepatitis-B goes  away on its own.You can relieve your symptoms at home by resting,eating healthy foods,drinking a plenty of water,and avoiding alcohol and drugs.Also,find out from your doctor what medicines and herbal products to avoid,because some can make liver damage caused by hepatitis-B worse.</p>
<p>Treatment for chronic hepatitis-B depends on whether your infection is getting worse and whether you have liver damage.Most people with chronic hepatitis-B can live active,full lives by taking care of themselves and getting regular checkups.There are medicines for chronic hepatitis-B,but they may not be right for everyone.Work with  your doctor to decide if medicine is right for you.</p>
