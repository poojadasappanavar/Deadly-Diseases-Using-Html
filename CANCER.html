<p>Cancer is a genetic disease-that is it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cell function,especially how they grow and devide</p>
<p >It can start in any place in the body.It starts when cells grow out of control and crowd out normal cells.This makes it hard for the body to work <br/>the way it should.
Cancer can be treated very well for many people.Infact,more people than ever before lead full lives after cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Normal cells may become cancer cells.Before cancer cells form in tissues of the body,the cells go through abnormal changes called"Hyperplasia"<br/>and"dysplasia".In hyperplasia there is an increase in number of cells in an organ or tissue that appear normal under microscope.In dysplasia the cells<br/> look abnormal under a microscope but are not<br/> cancer.Hyperplasia and Dysplasia may or maynot become cancer.</p>
